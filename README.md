# Radiolysis of Liquid Methane in the TS1 Moderators

The code in this repository was based on the maths in the Evans paper. The paper used estimated data to calculate a approximate values for the hydrogen gas and polymer production rate in the TS1 liquid methane moderator.
The maths was then taken and expanded upon using data acheived from an MCNP simulation to split the moderator into sections and calculate more accurate values for the production rates.

Then dwell times data was implemented in order to see the total polymer produced in the moderator.
